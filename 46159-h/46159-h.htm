<p><br />ahmoud, swinging
his wrinkled old trunk
to and fro dejectedly,
ignored the stack of fresh timothy
which the Keeper had
dumped on the floor of the
Elephant House. There was
a band of iron clasped tightly just
above one of his great forefeet.
Mahmoud had surged back in his discontent
till the chain, attached to the iron and to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>ring in the floor, creaked with the strain upon
it. His broad ears flapped forward listlessly,
but not far enough to conceal the moisture
in his dim old eyes which gathered now and
then into glistening drops that rolled down
his cheeks and were lost in the huge wrinkles
at the corners of his mouth. Duchess, his
faithful mate, who stood at his side twisting
up bunches of hay and tucking them into
her mouth, understood and was sad. At intervals
in her repast she would pause to stroke
Mahmoud's furrowed cheek with the tip of
her trunk. But her sorrowful mate was not
to be wooed from his melancholy.</p>

<p>Presently, from a little distance up the
Park walk leading to the door of the Elephant
House, came a familiar tinkling sound
that caused Mahmoud to turn his head in
that direction with a show of interest. A boy
was approaching, and at every step some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>straps of iron on his little crooked leg clanked
together. The sound was not unlike that
made by the iron on Mahmoud's leg. The
boy's face was pale, but his eyes were blue
and very bright. A little girl skipped along
at his side. The boy's clothes were shabby,
but the little girl's plumage was rich and as
gay as that of some tropical bird. Perhaps
it was this that caused the boy to call her
"Princess," when he made slow and deferential
response to her eager chatter. It was
plain that she was accustomed to rule, for
whenever she was admonished by the young
woman in dark clothes who followed a few
steps behind with a book under her arm, she
would merely shrug her pretty shoulders.
Her manner toward the boy was a trifle condescending,
but it was also affectionate, for
she called him "Toots."</p>

<p>The entire front of the Elephant House
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>was open, for it was summer. When Toots
and the Princess had reached the iron railing
within a yard of Mahmoud's swaying trunk,
they stopped. The young woman in dark
clothes seemed to understand that this was
their destination, for she seated herself on a
bench at the side of the walk, and was soon
deep in the pages of her book.</p>

<p>Mahmoud shuffled forward as far as the
chain on his leg would let him, thrust forth
his trunk and felt gently the iron on the
boy's crippled leg.</p>

<p>"Oh, Toots, he knows you!" exclaimed
the Princess. "That is what he did yesterday."</p>

<p>Though the Princess shrank back, Toots
showed no fear. Appearing satisfied as to the
boy's identity, Mahmoud turned to his mate,
and they stood cheek by cheek, swaying their
trunks in unison.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>"They are talking again," said the Princess,
with a little shriek of delight. "Toots,
you must tell me what they are saying to
each other."</p>

<p>Toots did not stir. A flush of pink had
stolen into his pale cheeks. There was a far-away
look in his eyes, yet they were sparkling.
His lips were moving, but no sound
came from them at first. Strange mumblings
were coming from the cavernous
mouths of the elephants. The Princess
stamped her foot with authority and commanded:</p>

<p>"Toots, tell me, as you did yesterday,
what the elephants are saying."</p>

<p>But already, in a low, monotonous voice,
as though in a dream, the boy was interpreting
the talk of Mahmoud and his mate.</p>

<p>"Behold, it is the little Limping Boy,"
said Mahmoud, with his lips close to the ear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>of Duchess. "My old eyes are dim, but with
my two fingers have I felt the iron on his
leg, and I know it is he."</p>

<p>"Verily, it is he, my Lord," answered
Duchess, caressingly. "And with him again
is the strange little bird without wings&mdash;or,
mayhap the gaudy creature is of his own
people."</p>

<p>"It is well. Do you recall, O Light of
my Life, how the little Limping Boy stood
at our door and talked softly to himself? I
remember such a boy long, long ago in the
Jungle, before the days of my captivity, only
he was naked and had brown skin&mdash;as brown
as that of my baby sister."</p>

<p>"I, too, saw and heard him, my Lord. I
thought he talked of us and pitied us in our
captivity."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a><br /><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/007.jpg">
<img src="images/007_th.jpg" alt="Elephants" style="width: 50%" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center">"Toots, tell me as you did yesterday, what the elephants
are saying."</p></div>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Mahmoud ceased his talk and for a
moment reflected deeply. At length he said:</p>

<p>"Lo, there are two worlds, O Light of
my Life, the Master World and the Menial
World; and few there be that stand between.
I know not how it happens that we, thou
and I, my beloved, are of the Menial World,
but it is so. We be Menial People, and the
little Limping Boy is of the Master People;
yet it clings in my mind that he is
nearer."</p>

<p>Again Mahmoud paused to reflect; but
Duchess broke in with conviction, saying:</p>

<p>"My Lord, may it not be that the little
Limping Boy is one that stands between?"</p>

<p>"That is a matter upon which I have
pondered deeply," sighed Mahmoud. "It is
evident that he understands our talk. He
has the iron upon his leg, yet his talk is not
the talk of the Menial People. Alas, I can
not be sure on this point. These Master
People have strange ways and a strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>tongue. When their skins are dark, as they
are in the jungle, their talk is not so difficult;
but when their skins are white and covered
with strange raiment, their words convey
no meaning to my ears."</p>

<p>Mahmoud's head drooped again. He was
very old, and, like all those who are burdened
with years, he was wont to ponder
sadly on the joys of his past. But presently
he raised his head and seemed to be listening.</p>

<p>"Look, Friend of my Youth," he said,
after a moment, "is it the chirp of our merry
little gossip, the sparrow, that I hear?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord," answered Duchess, soothingly,
"Pwit-Pwit is late this morning. I
tremble when I recall his boastful tale of
yesterday; how he entered the cage of the
lioness' treacherous young cubs."</p>

<p>"Be calm, beloved," said Mahmoud, "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>cubs are not too young to know the Law of
the Menial People."</p>

<p>It appeared that Duchess, being of the
weaker sex, and devoted to her domestic
duties, had but a vague notion of the Law.
So Mahmoud, with much dignity, enlightened
her in these words:</p>

<p>"It is the Law of the Menial People, O
Joy of my Heart, that Pwit-Pwit, the sparrow,
shall go and come at his pleasure
throughout the Menial World, enjoying the
hospitality and protection of all. And of a
truth this is meet, for is not the sparrow
official news-gatherer and gossip for all the
Menial People? Verily, is not he the only
one of our world that is not locked fast in a
yard or in an iron cage by the Master People?
Lo, when we of the Menial World
were brought by our masters from the forests
and plains and jungles to the place of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>our captivity, Pwit-Pwit was already here to
give us welcome. Therefore, it is the Law
of the Menial World that no claw nor tooth
shall be raised against him."</p>

<p>When Mahmoud had finished his discourse
the sparrow suddenly dropped out of
the sky at his feet with a chirp and a cheerful
toss of his head.</p>

<p>"You are late to breakfast this morning,
little one," said Mahmoud; "but I waited
for you, O Messenger of Cheer, though my
beloved mate has eaten a few mouthfuls, being
hungrier than I."</p>

<p>"I would have been here sooner," answered
the sparrow, "but I found it necessary
to give one of those young lions a lesson.
He forgot about the Law, and tried to catch
me in his mouth. But I was too quick for
him. You should have seen me then. I flew
at his eyes and gave them a good pecking.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Then I had to go and tell his mother.
Didn't you hear her roaring at the little upstart
to behave himself? Oh, you can trust
me to educate those young lions in the
Law."</p>

<p>"Verily, I heard the mother lion roar, and
feared for you," said Mahmoud. "But come,
there are some choice grass seeds in the deep
wrinkles of my neck, and I will scatter more
there for you. If you are tired, you can step
on the end of my trunk and I will lift you
up to your breakfast."</p>

<p>But Pwit-Pwit said that he was not at all
tired. He flew up to Mahmoud's shoulders
and was soon pecking greedily at the seeds
which he found in the wrinkles between the
great flapping ears. Duchess had resumed
her repast, and Mahmoud began attacking
the stack of timothy with manifest appetite.
As the two friends, one so huge and the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>so tiny, took their breakfast together, the
sparrow chirped a constant torrent of gossip,
which Toots, never hesitating, interpreted
for the Princess. At
length only some scattering
wisps were left of the
stack that the Keeper had
brought for the old elephant.
Mahmoud gathered
them up, sweeping his
trunk over the floor daintily,
then rolled them into
a little bundle, which he
thrust half-way into the
side of his mouth. Then, rolling his trunk
about the ends of the wisps containing the
dried grass seeds, he tore them off, and
holding them back over his head, said to
Pwit-Pwit:</p>

<p>"Are you there, little one?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/014.jpg" alt="Pwit-Pwit" style="width: 100%" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>"Here I am, right between your ears,"
chirped the sparrow.</p>

<p>"Look then for the large round seeds,"
said Mahmoud. "But first brace yourself
well behind my ear, little one, for I am going
to blow the dust out of your breakfast.
Dust is not good for the stomach."</p>

<p>With these words Mahmoud blew a little
puff of wind through his trunk into the
handful of grass seed about which it was
curled, and then dropped the seeds in a little
shower right at Pwit-Pwit's feet.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the sparrow. "You
have found me a delicious breakfast." And
he pecked away at the seeds until he could
hold no more.</p>

<p>Then Pwit-Pwit noticed that Mahmoud
had stopped eating and was swinging his
trunk about in a mournful manner.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, old chap?" chirped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>the sparrow. "Have you lost your appetite?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" sighed the old elephant, "I pine
for the roar of my native Jungle, little one.
I long to plunge through the great, wild forest
and feel the swish of the branches at my
sides. Even the chatter of idle and foolish
monkeys would be music in my ears."</p>

<p>The sparrow hopped up on the rim of
Mahmoud's ear, and said cheerily:</p>

<p>"Why don't you go home for a visit?"</p>

<p>"Alas, little one, I am too old, even if the
Master People would release me. Never
again shall I breathe the fresh breath of the
hills; never again hear the roar of the Jungle."</p>

<p>Mahmoud's head drooped lower than before.
Pwit-Pwit pecked at his ear to get his
attention, and chirped:</p>

<p>"Cheer up, old chap, I can't bring the
Jungle to you, 'tis true; but I think I can
manage the roar all right."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<p>"Pride of my Heart," said Mahmoud,
turning eagerly to his faithful mate and
stroking her cheek, "do you hear? Pwit-Pwit,
the all-wise, says he can gladden our
ears once more with the roar of the
Jungle."</p>

<p>"Pwit-Pwit, if you can do that," said
Duchess, trembling with joy, "we will be
your slaves."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is nothing, nothing at all," chirped
the sparrow with affected modesty. "I will
go and prepare all the Menial People for the
signal, and when I return I will tell you
what to do."</p>

<p>Having chirped this promise into Mahmoud's
grateful ear, the sparrow flew down
from the old elephant's back, and hopped
past the little Limping Boy and entered the
adjoining house of the two-horned rhinoceros.
Toots and the Princess could see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>all that occurred from where they stood.
The great beast was lazily sharpening his
horns on the hardwood planks of his house.
Pwit-Pwit flew at his eyes, at which he
pecked saucily, saying:</p>

<p>"Attention, pig! Be ready for the signal.
When you hear it, if you have any voice left
in your fat old carcass, use it, or never hope
to hear the roar of the Jungle again."</p>

<p>Hearing these words, the dull-witted beast
began lifting up first one foot and then
another, in a sort of clumsy dance. The
sparrow, perceiving that he was eager for the
roar of the Jungle, wasted no more words
on him, but flew straight up in the air and
then darted off toward the house of the
lions, tigers and leopards. Toots and the
Princess saw him fly in through the open
door, then, after a moment of silence, heard
muffled roars from the lions, followed by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>excited chatter of monkeys in the adjoining
house, and soon beheld him emerge
and dart toward the dens of the bears.</p>

<p>"The sparrow is keeping his word," said
the Princess, clapping her hands. "He is
warning all the Menial People to be ready
for the signal."</p>

<p>"Hush," said the little Limping Boy, in a
low voice. "Look at Mahmoud and the
Duchess."</p>

<p>The Princess looked, and beheld a most
astonishing sight. The old elephants had
twined their trunks together above their
heads and were waving them as though in
time to music.</p>

<p>"They are singing," said Toots. "They
are singing about the happy times they had
long, long ago in the great forest where they
were born."</p>

<p>The Princess could not hear the song, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>she beheld the waving trunks and felt certain
that Toots could hear it. As they sang,
the old elephants grew each moment more
excited. So engrossed were they with the
memories that inspired them that they forgot
the sparrow utterly. When Pwit-Pwit
returned, he had to fly up and peck at their
eyes to get their attention.</p>

<p>"Do stop your singing and pay attention,"
chirped the sparrow, petulantly. "You
can sing at any time. Listen. I have prepared
all the Menial People for the signal.
They are waiting. You can hear the chatter
of those idiotic monkeys at this moment.
A monkey can never keep a secret."</p>

<p>"The lions," said Mahmoud, eagerly, "are
the lions ready?"</p>

<p>"The lions were delighted," answered
Pwit-Pwit; "they can hardly wait for the
signal."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>"And Caliph and Fatimah, the old hippopotami&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They, too, are ready," interrupted the
sparrow, impatiently. "I told you I could
manage it, and I have. The signal! The
signal!"</p>

<p>As he gave this order, Pwit-Pwit flew up
to his favorite perch on Mahmoud's ear.
The elephants, trembling with excitement,
turned their faces toward the Lion House
and wagged their trunks aloft. Mahmoud's
eyes opened to twice their usual size, and
the little Limping Boy thought that they
shone red, as though from anger. He was
half afraid, and wondered what was going to
happen. The Princess clasped his hand
tightly in one of hers, and he could feel that
she was trembling.</p>

<p>"It must be all right," said Toots, "or
the sparrow would fly away. See, he still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>sits on the rim of the old elephant's ear, as
calm as you please."</p>

<p>Suddenly Mahmoud straightened out his
trunk to its full length toward the Lion
House, and blew through it a blast that rang
in the ears of the two children for many a
day after. Duchess followed with another,
shriller and more ear-splitting. Then the
two elephants paused to listen. Almost immediately
they were answered from the Lion
House. First, Sultan replied with a deep,
terrible roar that caused Mahmoud's eyes to
sparkle with delight. Then Caliph, the patriarch
of all the hippopotami, joined his
voice to that of the old lion. It was a voice
like the sound of a mighty waterfall. Between
the roars of Sultan and Caliph could
be heard those of Fatimah and Cyrus, the
younger hippopotami, whose voices were less
deep and steady, because not so well trained.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<p>From all directions came answers to
Mahmoud's signal. There was the snarling
scream of the tigers, leopards and pumas;
the wolves and hyenas barked in their wild
and dreadful way; the bears growled; eagles
screamed; the shrieking chatter of the monkeys
was ear-splitting. The two-horned rhinoceros
grunted terribly. The solitary elephant
next door, who was in disgrace for
attacking the Keeper, put his four feet close
together, humped up his back and trumpeted
so loudly that Mahmoud and Duchess
held their breath and listened, overcome
with joy.</p>

<p>At length, having recognized the voices
of all the Menial People, Mahmoud and
Duchess again stretched forth their trunks
and trumpeted with all their might. At
this the efforts of all the animals were redoubled.
This was indeed the roar of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>Jungle. The ground seemed to tremble,
so terrible was the din. The Keeper, who
often went fearlessly into the cage of Sultan,
even putting his hand in the great brute's
mouth, could be seen running from the Lion
House, pale, and with his hair on end. And
through it all the sparrow never moved from
his perch on the rim of Mahmoud's ear.</p>

<p>But after a while the roar gradually died
out, leaving all the Menial People breathless
and covered with perspiration.</p>

<p>"Aha," said Pwit-Pwit, into the ear of
old Mahmoud, "didn't I tell you I could
manage the roar of the Jungle?"</p>

<p>"Little one," answered the grateful beast,
gasping for breath, "we are your slaves from
this day on."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," chirped back the sparrow;
"it was fun for me, too. Never before was
heard such a roar. The Master People were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>terrified. Did you not observe them flying
in all directions?"</p>

<p>"Ay, little one, I saw them, and it gladdened
my old heart. Even the Keeper, he
that is so proud and stout of heart, fled as I
have seen his brown-skinned brothers flee
before my onslaught in the Jungle. Verily,
all the Master People fled&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mahmoud stopped, with his eye fixed in
astonishment on the little Limping Boy, who
stood as before, with his arms on the iron
railing, calm and unmoved. As though
doubting the evidence of his eyes, Mahmoud
put forth his trunk, and with the two fingers
at its end felt of the iron on the boy's
leg. Then he turned to Duchess and said:</p>

<p>"Behold, O Light of my Life, of all the
Master People only the little Limping Boy
remained, his soul unterrified by the roar of
the Jungle. With my two fingers have I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>again felt the iron on his leg. No longer
do I doubt."</p>

<p>Then turning to the sparrow, Mahmoud,
Lord of all the Menial People, gave this
command:</p>

<p>"Go forth, little one, to all my people;
to the lions, to the tigers, to the hippopotami,
to the old dromedary who stands all
day blinking in the sun, yea, even to the
chattering monkeys, and say: Lo, this is
the command of Mahmoud, that no harm
shall befall the little Limping Boy, for verily,
he doth stand between. I have spoken."</p>

<p>The sparrow flew away to do his master's
bidding, and from that day on Toots was
able to interpret for the Princess even the
sign language spoken by the blinking old
dromedary, who to all but him was the
sphinx of the Zoo, deep of thought, but generally
uncommunicative.</p>

<p><br /><br />he great round, soft,
brown eyes of Dozel,
most slender-limbed and
graceful of the herd of Indian
deer, were fixed on the face
of the little Limping Boy.
There seemed to be a look of
pity in their depths. She
licked Toots' fingers, and the Princess tried
in vain to attract her attention.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>"Do you suppose the sparrow has already
told her of Mahmoud's command?" asked
the Princess.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Toots; "I
think so, but I haven't quite made up my
mind yet."</p>

<p>"Dozel seems more affectionate toward
you than ever," argued the Princess. "Yesterday
she licked my hand, but to-day she
has eyes only for you, Toots."</p>

<p>"It must be so, then," said the little
Limping Boy. "You remember that when
the elephant ordered Pwit-Pwit to go and
tell all the Menial People that I stood between
the two worlds, and that no harm
should befall me, the sparrow flew away immediately.
But, look! here comes Pwit-Pwit
now. He and Dozel are going to have their
morning chat. Keep quite still, and I'll tell
you what they say."</p>

<p>The Princess put her finger on her lip
and looked significantly at Toots, as the
sparrow perched herself on the top rail of
the yard, within a foot of Dozel's ear, and
began to chirp. The Princess saw the familiar,
dreamy look come into Toots' eyes,
as he began to translate the gossip of the
sparrow and the deer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a><br /><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>




<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/029.jpg">
<img src="images/029_th.jpg" alt="Deer" style="width: 50%" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center">The soft, brown eyes of
Dozel were fixed on the face of the little Limping Boy.</p></div>
</div>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why are you so sad this morning?"
asked Pwit-Pwit. "The weather is simply
perfect."</p>

<p>But Dozel merely sighed, and turned her
gaze wistfully in the direction of the Elephant
House. Nothing so delighted her as
the loud trumpetings of Mahmoud and his
mate, and she always let her eyes roam in
their direction when anything unusual was
on her mind.</p>

<p>"You ought to be happy," continued the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>sparrow; "you certainly never looked handsomer,
with your brown skin so soft and
velvety that the little white spots scattered
over it look like snowflakes, and your eyes
so clear and tender&mdash;tut, tut, now Dozel,
my dear. The idea of your crying on a
morning like this!"</p>

<p>"I can't help it," whimpered the beautiful
creature. "It's enough to make any one
weep."</p>

<p>Pwit-Pwit hopped on to Dozel's back and
together they took a turn about the yard.</p>

<p>"And I'm blest if you're not limping, you,
of all people in the world!" said the sparrow,
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"It's out of sympathy," sighed Dozel.
"When I think of my own legs, so straight
and slender and swift, I can't help thinking of
the little Limping Boy and his poor, crooked
leg, with the iron on it. There he stands
now. Isn't it pitiful? Oh, dear, oh, dear!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>"True, it is very sad," said Pwit-Pwit, soberly;
"but what can't be cured must be
endured, you know."</p>

<p>"The worst part of it," said the deer, "is
that there is something about the little
Limping Boy's walk that reminds me of
those chattering, screaming monkeys I remember
so well in the jungle. There are
some of them over in a corner of the Lion
House. I can't bear them."</p>

<p>"Hello!" chirped the sparrow, jubilantly.
"So that's your opinion of 'em, too, is it,
Dozel, my dear? Well, that's too good to
keep. I'll go straight to the monkeys with
that, and when they know that it comes
from you direct, they'll have a bad half-hour,
I can tell you. They won't be any
happier than you are then, my dear. Do
you know, the impudent creatures actually
claim to be related to the birds! As a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>general thing, I pay no attention to 'em, but
this is different. They feel so sure of your
good opinion, you're so sweet and sedate
with everybody. My, oh, my, but won't it
make 'em wild! I'll go straight to that
idiot, Mr. Kelly. Just listen, and you'll
hear him jabber himself blue in the face."</p>

<p>With this, the malicious little bird flew
straight into the Lion House, and to Mr.
Kelly's corner, Toots and the Princess following
as fast as their legs could carry them,
the iron on the little Limping Boy's leg
clanking all the way.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Kelly is a very learned monkey,
having enjoyed the society of men for
quite a number of years. He had had
breakfast, and was leisurely picking his teeth.
Pwit-Pwit perched himself on the rail just
out of reach of his nimble fingers. Truth
to tell, the sparrow was so startled at Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>Kelly's resemblance to the man who carried
the plaster when the bear's den was being
repaired, that he was quite civil at first.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Kelly," he said politely,
"are you feeling quite well?"</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/035.jpg" alt="Good morning, Mr. Kelly" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>"So-so," answered the monkey, eying the
sparrow with much deliberation.
"Except for my
neuralgia and a touch of
the gout I'm in my usual
health, thank you. You
don't happen to have
a cigar about you, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said Pwit-Pwit, astounded
and quite off his guard, "you don't mean to
say you smoke?"</p>

<p>"Had my cigar after breakfast every
morning when I was acting in a theater over
in the Bowery," said Mr. Kelly. "Seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>that smoking isn't allowed here. These
blue laws are beastly, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Do you find it hard going without?"
asked Pwit-Pwit, unable yet to assume his
accustomed air of superiority.</p>

<p>"If they would let me taper off I wouldn't
mind so much," answered the monkey, with
a yawn; "but this stopping all at once is
rather trying on the nerves."</p>

<p>Toots shifted his position in front of the
monkey's cage, which caused the iron on
his leg to jingle. This attracted the attention
of Mr. Kelly, who threw away the
straw he had been using as a toothpick and
came close to the wire netting that surrounded
him.</p>

<p>"You heard the command of Mahmoud
to all the Menial People touching the little
Limping Boy," said the sparrow. "Well,
here he is."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>Instead of replying, Mr. Kelly began
twisting his features into the drollest shapes
imaginable.</p>

<p>"Mahmoud's command has made a great
stir everywhere," continued Pwit-Pwit. "It
has affected Dozel to tears. I left her just
now weeping over the misfortunes of the
little Limping Boy."</p>

<p>At this Mr. Kelly began to snivel and
moan, while two tears rolled
down his hairy nose.</p>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/037.jpg" alt="Pwit-Pwit" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>"Hello, there! What's
the matter with you?"
demanded Pwit-Pwit.</p>

<p>The monkey made no reply,
but began limping around his cage,
moaning and shedding tears, as though
heart-broken.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said the sparrow, "you're
sorry for the little Limping Boy, too."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have a fellow-feeling for him,"
answered Mr. Kelly, and went on with his
moaning.</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;you miserable upstart!" exclaimed
Pwit-Pwit, ruffling up his feathers
in indignation.</p>

<p>The sparrow would have said more but
for the sudden change in Mr. Kelly's manner.
The monkey had come back to the
front of his cage, and was touching the side of
his head with the forefinger of his right hand.</p>

<p>"What are you up to now?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Saluting my unfortunate distant relation,"
said Mr. Kelly, who then went on
moaning and weeping worse than before.</p>

<p>For a moment the sparrow's indignation
was such that he seemed to be deprived of
speech. He looked at Mr. Kelly, and then
at the little Limping Boy, and then at the
monkey again. Then he ruffled up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>feathers of his neck angrily, and said:</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you believe
yourself to be related to this boy, who will
grow into a man some day?"</p>



<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/039.jpg" alt="That's the tradition in our family" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>"That's the tradition in our family," said
Mr. Kelly, "and you doubtless know that
tradition is the basis of all history.
Besides, that's what a
very celebrated man once said
in a lecture at the theater where
I acted, and he had me on the
stage with him for
an illustration&mdash;so
he said. Any one
can see that there isn't much difference between
a monkey and a man, except the
clothes. Look for yourself."</p>

<p>And Mr. Kelly placed his right elbow in his
left hand, and rested his chin on his right hand,
just as the little Limping Boy was doing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>Pwit-Pwit looked from one to the other,
and the resemblance was so startling that
for a moment he was at a loss what answer
to make. Then he caught sight of the
monkey's tail, which Mr. Kelly was trying
hard to conceal behind him.</p>

<p>"Aha!" chirped the sparrow, exultantly;
"what about the tail?"</p>

<p>"None of your business, you meddlesome,
gossiping little wretch!" screamed Mr. Kelly,
in a passion. And he made a grab for
Pwit-Pwit through the wires of his cage, but
could not quite reach him.</p>

<p>"Be careful," warned the sparrow. "Remember
the Law."</p>

<p>"Know this once for all, you insignificant
bearer of tales," snarled Mr. Kelly. "Mahmoud
himself has said that he was in doubt
whether I was of the Menial People, or
whether I stood between the two worlds. Ere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>long I shall compel him to proclaim that I
am neither the one nor the other, but that
I am of the Master People. So beware!"</p>

<p>But Pwit-Pwit nearly burst his sides with
laughter.</p>

<p>"Do you know what Dozel says about
you?" he said finally; "the beautiful young
Indian doe at whom you
have been making eyes
through the wires of your
cage ever since she arrived?"</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/041.jpg" alt="Pwit-Pwit" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>Mr. Kelly suddenly
turned very pale. Noticing this, the sparrow
went on relentlessly:</p>

<p>"She says that you and all your tribe are
chattering, screaming nobodies."</p>

<p>For a moment the blow seemed almost
more than Mr. Kelly could endure.</p>

<p>"Aha, Mr. Kelly," said the sparrow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>insolently, "chattering, screaming nobodies!
What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>At this taunt Mr. Kelly nearly exploded
with passion. He clenched his hand and
shook it at the sparrow, and
screamed at the top of his
voice:</p>

<p>"Jocko! Jocko! Do
you hear? This
meddlesome
wretch of a sparrow
says we are
chattering
nobodies."</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/042.jpg" alt="long-tailed
monkeys with black caps" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>Jocko, the tottering old baboon in his
cage on the other side of the Lion House,
turned blue in the face with anger.</p>

<p>"Catch him and pull out his tail feathers!"
he screamed. "Never mind the
Law."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>But Pwit-Pwit kept well out of Mr. Kelly's
reach. By this time, the little, long-tailed
monkeys with black caps and high-pitched
voices, living next door to Jocko,
were chattering and shrieking at a fearful
rate. The sparrow flew about from one
cage to another, hurling taunts at the enraged
creatures, enjoying himself immensely.</p>

<p>When, at length, the monkeys had chattered
and shrieked themselves hoarse, Mr.
Kelly commanded them to be silent while
he arranged for a final settlement of the
dispute. He walked in a dignified manner
about his cage until he had recovered his
breath, and then said sternly to Pwit-Pwit:</p>

<p>"You are only a foolish little bird, with a
great deal to learn. While we care very
little for your opinion, it is well that this
matter should be settled. Is there any one
among all the Menial People whose word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>you will accept as the eternal truth?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the sparrow, promptly.
"There is Caliph, the old hippopotamus. He
is very old and very wise, and he always
tells the truth&mdash;which is more than can be
said of monkeys."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mr. Kelly, calmly, "go
and ask Caliph if it is not true that the first
man and the first monkey were made out of
the same lump of clay long, long ago on the
banks of the river Nile. Tell him to lift up
his voice when he answers, so that all can
hear."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Pwit-Pwit; "and when you
hear old Caliph's answer prepare to hang
crape on your door-knob, for it will mean
the death of your absurd ambition."</p>

<p>Then, while Mr. Kelly continued to walk
about his cage in a dignified manner, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>sparrow, followed by Toots and the Princess,
flew quickly to the Hippopotamus
House. Straight up to the edge of the deep
pool in which Caliph lay, with only an island
of black back and his two bulging
nostrils showing above the surface of the
water, hopped Pwit-Pwit.</p>

<p>"What, ho! Caliph!" chirped the sparrow,
"come forth from thy meditations and
give ear to a matter of consequence concerning
all the Menial People."</p>

<p>At first Caliph only blinked his small
eyes. Pwit-Pwit bobbed his head at the
monster with evidence of vast respect, and
said in a louder voice:</p>

<p>"Greeting, O master of the deep! It is
concerning the general welfare that I come
to disturb thy reflections on the glorious
past. The pretensions of the monkeys have
grown past all bounds, so that there is menace
to the general peace. The trouble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>happened in this wise: Mr. Kelly, who is
only a poor sort of monkey, at best, claims
kinship with the Master World, whereat
there is much discontent and not a little
jealousy. He avers that the first monkey
and the first man were made out of the
same lump of clay on the banks of the Nile.
Is this the truth? Speak, I pray you, in
tones that may be heard by all, that the
trouble which threatens us may be averted."</p>

<p>While the sparrow thus spoke, Caliph
raised his head slowly out of the water.
Seven times did he open and close his enormous
mouth. At length, in a voice that
rang throughout the Menial World, he spoke
as follows:</p>

<p>"Harken unto me, all ye Menial People.
As to the first monkey, it was in this wise:
When the first man had been made, his
shadow fell upon some very poor clay that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>had been thrown away. And it came to
pass that when the first man walked, and
his shadow walked after him, the poor clay
upon which the shadow rested rose and ran
shrieking into the forest. And, lo! it was
a monkey. Behold, I have spoken."</p>

<p>When Caliph had sunk beneath the water
again, Pwit-Pwit, with his head on one side,
listened eagerly for the comments of the
other Menial People, and Toots, with his
hand placed warningly on the Princess, listened,
too. First, Mahmoud trumpeted his
acquiescence:</p>

<p>"It is true. I heard it from my father in
the Jungle one day when these insolent chatterers
were particularly annoying. The
monkeys are but as chips that fall from the
hewn log."</p>

<p>"Behold, Caliph's words are the words
of wisdom," said Sultan, patriarch of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>lions, in his deepest roar. "I, who was born
in the shadow of the great pyramids, had it
from my father, who had it from the father
of Caliph when he went down to the Nile
to drink. Lo! the monkeys are as the chaff
when the wheat is winnowed."</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/049.jpg" alt="Pwit-Pwit" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>"I am not of that country," said the old
dromedary from the plains of Arabia; "but
my cousins, the camels, known to all the
world as ships of the desert, brought the
news to my people. By the fat in my hump,
I swear that Caliph speaks the truth."</p>

<p>"My grandmother had it from an aged
crocodile who crawled up on the bank of
the Nile to sun herself, just as she was laying
in the hot sand the egg that hatched my
mother," screamed the old cock ostrich.
"The monkeys are of no more consequence
than straws blown by the wind."</p>

<p>And no voice among the Menial People
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>was silent. Those who had no testimony
to add to that of Caliph, roared and
screeched and howled their approval of it.
But the monkeys did not remain long
abashed at the verdict against them. When
Pwit-Pwit, followed by Toots and the Princess,
returned to observe
its effect upon
them, they found Mr.
Kelly sitting cross-legged
on his overturned
water bucket, with his chin in
his hand, meditating deeply.</p>

<p>"Well," chirped Pwit-Pwit, "did you
hear the verdict of old Caliph?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" said Mr. Kelly, raising his head abstractedly.
"Hum, ah, oh, yes, I heard it."</p>

<p>"And the corroboration of all the other
Menial People?"</p>

<p>"All my expectations were verified," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Mr. Kelly, complacently. "Malice and
prejudice were so apparent that every logical
mind will at once class the statements of
Caliph and his satellites as perjured testimony.
My contention, therefore, is sustained."</p>

<p>Too perplexed and astonished to make
any reply, Pwit-Pwit flew away to his favorite
perch on the rim of Mahmoud's ear,
where he sat, crestfallen, for fully three and
a quarter minutes.</p>

</div>


<p><br /><br />ll the morning there had
been an excited running
to and fro among
the Keepers of the Menial
World. Evidences
of a stupendous mystery
were apparent on
every hand. It seemed
to center in the Hippopotamus House, the
doors of which were locked and barred, as
well as those of the Lion House adjoining it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>The Princess, devoured by curiosity, deluged
Toots with questions. While awaiting developments,
they were feeding peanuts to
Zuelma, the vain young mother ostrich.
For quite a while the little Limping Boy
was unable to get any light on the mystery.</p>

<p>"If the sparrow were only here," said
the Princess, "there would be a lot of gossip
about it; wouldn't there, Toots?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the boy; "but we won't
have to wait long. Listen, Mahmoud is
beginning to rumble through his trunk.
Twice old Sultan has roared under his
breath, and a moment ago the tigers were
snarling. The secret will soon be out&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant, Sultan, patriarch of the
lions, delivered himself of a mighty roar.
Even the Princess could tell by the sound
of it that it was not a roar of anger.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Toots, "that is old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>Sultan's call for rejoicing. Now listen."</p>



<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/053.jpg" alt="Lion" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>Mahmoud was first to reply. The old
elephant trumpeted a hearty response, in
which the other elephants joined. After
that there were growls from the bears, snarls
from the tigers and pumas, and an extraordinary
chattering
among the monkeys.
Throughout
all the Menial
World there was
only one note of
discord, one failure
to respond heartily to the call for rejoicing.
When the other voices had subsided,
up spoke the aged striped hyena in
his evil-tempered voice, demanding:</p>

<p>"Wherefore rejoice? What has befallen
in the Lion House that gives cause for
rejoicing?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<p>The roar with which Sultan prefaced his
reply was so terrible that the ill-favored
beast cowered back into the farthest corner
of his den. Said Sultan:</p>

<p>"Not for this suspicious, thieving, ill-conditioned
creature, but for all the loyal inhabitants
of the Menial World shall the
answer be given. Harken to the voice of
Caliph, the Wise."</p>

<p>For a moment there was deep silence.
Then spoke Caliph, patriarch of the hippopotami,
in his rumbling roar, resembling that
of the cataracts of the Upper Nile, within
the sound of which his youth had been
spent:</p>

<p>"Lo, Fatimah, my beloved mate, hath an
infant daughter. Mother and child are
doing well; therefore, rejoice."</p>

<p>Whereat there was such general and
hearty rejoicing that all the houses of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>Menial People rocked on their foundations.
But when the sound of it had died away,
the aged hyena could be heard
snarling:</p>

<p>"Pooh! only one? Though
my mate brought me four
daughters and a son one morning
as I was gnawing the leg
bone of a sheep, yet
I made no uproar
about it."</p>

<p>"That is because you
are a selfish, thieving,
carrion-eating old hypocrite,"
thundered back Caliph.</p>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/055.jpg" alt="Ostrich" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>Zuelma, with her bill wide
open, as is her custom while
listening, stood with her long
neck craned over the head of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>the little Limping Boy, in whose hand that
of the Princess&mdash;somewhat frightened by the
uproar among the animals&mdash;was tightly
clasped. Suddenly, Pwit-Pwit, the Sparrow
gossip and news-gatherer for all the Menial
People, fluttered down at her feet.</p>

<p>"I have been expecting you for an hour,"
said the ostrich. "Now, thank goodness,
we shall know the truth, after all this roaring
and trumpeting. How is it, Pwit-Pwit, that
so much fuss is made over a single baby?
Were the other eggs eaten by the crocodiles?"</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/056.jpg" alt="Crocodile" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>"As soon as I heard the call for rejoicing,"
said the sparrow, "I flew at once to
the Hippopotamus House; but the door was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>shut and no one came to let me in. But it
sticks in my mind, Zuelma, that the young
of the Hippopotamus are not hatched from
eggs."</p>

<p>At this, Zuelma, who was a mother herself,
laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>"If you were not a giddy, gadding sparrow,"
she said, "with neither mate nor nest
of your own, you would know that without
eggs and hot sand to hatch them in, there
would be no young in the world. Come,
go and try again. By this time the door
should be open."</p>

<p>The sparrow was no quicker than were
Toots and the Princess to profit by this hint.
They found the outer door of the Hippopotamus
House still closed; but that of the
Lion House was open, and also one connecting
the two. As Pwit-Pwit hopped past
the cage of the frolicsome lion cubs, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>tumbled over each other in their eagerness
to greet him.</p>

<p>"Ho, Pwit-Pwit," they roared in their
babyish voices,
"stop and tell us
the news."</p>



<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/058.jpg" alt="stop and tell us
the news" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>"Wait till I
come back,"
chirped the
sparrow;
"I'm busy now."
And he hurried on into the Hippopotamus
House and to the big tank where old Caliph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>was cooling himself after the excitement
of the morning. Toots and the Princess
stopped within a yard of him, eager to hear
what was said between them.</p>

<p>"Is it indeed true?" demanded Pwit-Pwit.
"Are you for the second time a
father?"</p>

<p>Caliph blinked at the sparrow, and
seemed to be turning something over in his
mind. Presently he opened his mouth
at least a yard and snorted so loudly that
the sparrow's feathers were drenched with
the spray from his nostrils.</p>

<p>"Such manners!" exclaimed Pwit-Pwit,
shaking himself vigorously. "What on earth
are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>"Father for the second time," repeated
Caliph, with a broad smile. "Why, little one,
my age is at least three-quarters of a century,
and all of our family wedded young. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>least a score of the young with which Fatimah
has presented me are to-day rolling
about the broad earth in gaudily painted
wheeled tanks for the amusement of the
Master World. Therefore, excuse me if I
smile decorously at your inquiry if it be true
that I am indeed a father for the second
time."</p>

<p>"Where are Fatimah and the new baby?"
demanded the sparrow, shortly, for Pwit-Pwit
never approved of laughter at his own
expense.</p>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/061.jpg" alt="Hippopotamus" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>"You'll find them over in the next tank,"
answered the father hippopotamus. "Never
yet was there such a baby for the water.
He has been to the surface to breathe only
twice since he was born. He will be a
great hippopotamus when he grows up."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," said Pwit-Pwit,
in surprise, "that Fatimah found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>the baby in the water to begin with?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," answered Caliph, "where
would you expect to find a new baby hippopotamus?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wonder what Zuelma will say
to that," chirped the
sparrow, as he hopped
along to the margin
of Fatimah's
tank. All
that could
be seen of the
mother hippopotamus
was a glistening yard or so of her black
back. This was floating about the tank in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>manner that indicated no little agitation
below the surface. The cause was apparent
when Fatimah lifted her head out of the
water, and said to Caliph:</p>

<p>"Alas! our new-born daughter is lost
again. I have searched every corner of the
tank in vain. Oh, what shall I do? What
shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Do not agitate yourself, my beloved,"
answered Caliph. "The little one is mischievous.
Thus it was, I remember, with
our first-born. Verily, it is a good sign."</p>

<p>Suddenly, while Caliph was speaking,
Fatimah plunged her nose into the water,
made a scooping motion, and rose quickly
to the surface, bringing the missing baby
with her. The Princess shrieked with delight
at sight of the coffee-colored little
image of its mother which lay sprawling
across her broad nose, blinking its
eyes and blowing spray from its nostrils.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a><br /><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a><br /></span></p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/063.jpg">
<img src="images/063_th.jpg" alt="Elephants" style="width: 50%" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center">The coffee-colored little image of its mother lay sprawling
across her broad nose.</p></div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"A fine child, Fatimah," said Pwit-Pwit.
"Many happy returns of the day."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, I'm sure," said
Fatimah, while the new baby shook its small
ears in imitation of its mother. "But what
a care these babies are," she added with a
sigh, "nobody but a mother knows."</p>

<p>Toots would have sworn that at this
moment Caliph winked slyly at his new
daughter, and that the baby gave her father
an answering wink. At any rate, as Fatimah
finished speaking, the baby slid from
her nose into the water with a splash, and
sank out of sight.</p>

<p>"Drat the child!" said Fatimah. "There's
no use," she added with a snort that sent a
ripple of waves over the surface of the water;
"she will do it. I shall simply leave
her there, young as she is, till she is obliged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>to come up for air. By the way, Pwit-Pwit,
little one, how are Cleopatra and her
monkey baby this morning?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you," answered the
sparrow, "and Cleopatra sends congratulations."</p>

<p>"Caliph, my love," said Fatimah, "I really
think that in honor of the occasion, we
should send a polite message to Cleopatra.
To be sure, I don't approve of monkeys at
all, but babies are babies, you know."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Caliph, gruffly, "send
the chattering young creature any message
you like, only keep me out of it."</p>

<p>"My experience certainly is greater than
Cleopatra's," said Fatimah, addressing the
sparrow, "and I would warn her against allowing
her baby to lie overlong in the sun.
It is apt to crack the skin. I remember
when my first child was born&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, bless my eyes!" interrupted Pwit-Pwit,
with a giggle, "Cleopatra asked me to
warn you against letting your baby get its
feet wet."</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" gasped Fatimah in astonishment,
while Caliph opened his mouth
till the Princess told Toots in a whisper that
she could see clear into his stomach, and
laughed till the tears rolled down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Well, I must be going," said the sparrow.
"Everybody is dying for the news.
Have you named the baby yet, Fatimah?"</p>

<p>"She shall be called Delilah, for her
beauty," said the proud mother, as her baby
came gasping and sputtering to the surface.
As Fatimah put down her nose for her child
to clamber upon, she said in a tone of loving
triumph:</p>

<p>"So-so, my child, it seems you still have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>some use for mother. Now will you be
good?"</p>

<p>Again the lion cubs roared at Pwit-Pwit
as he was passing, demanding the news:</p>

<p>"Where did the hippopotamus baby come
from? Did somebody leave the door open?"</p>

<p>"Fatimah found it at the bottom of her
swimming tank," answered the sparrow, and
he passed on, leaving the cubs staring at
each other in wonderment.</p>

<p>When Pwit-Pwit had made the rounds
with his gossip about the new baby, all the
Menial People who felt that their experience
entitled them to give advice touching
the bringing up of children, addressed themselves,
one at a time, to Fatimah and Caliph.</p>

<p>"As to the new babe," said the dromedary,
speaking first, "I would give a bit of advice.
Many a babe has suffered in its early days
from lack of water. So it was with my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>brother. His tongue became so parched
that he was never able to converse above
a whisper. I pray you, madam, to see that
your babe has water to drink at least once
a week."</p>

<p>"Ho-ho, ha-ha!" laughed Caliph. "Water
once a week, and only to drink&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear," said Fatimah, "the
dromedary means well, but, being of the
desert, he knows no better."</p>

<p>"If you would have his legs grow slim
and straight," said Dozel, the Indian doe,
"you must let him run over the hills as much
as possible while yet young. But I would
warn you to beware of the dogs and wolves."</p>

<p>"For exercise to strengthen the body there
is nothing like leaping," roared Sultan, the
lion. "Before I was a year old I could leap
full twenty feet to the shoulders of an antelope,
and never miss."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ho-ho, ha-ha!" roared Caliph again, till
reproved by Fatimah. But the picture of
any hippopotamus, young or old, running
over the hills, or leaping on to the shoulders
of an antelope, was irresistibly funny, and
Caliph continued to chuckle till Duchess,
Mahmoud's faithful mate, concluded the
chapter on how to bring up a young hippopotamus
with the following sensible advice:</p>

<p>"Behold, O Fatimah," she said, "one or
two matters which may have slipped your
memory, upon which I would give you
counsel. If the mother be sound, and the
new-born babe be without blot or blemish,
there is little to be feared. Yet, in my
time, have I seen the young over-eager for
their food, so that they grow to be unnaturally
ravenous, in time ruining their digestion
and destroying their moral sense.
Such a disposition noticed early in infancy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>is easily corrected, as you well know. If
your babe displays an inclination to turn
her head more to one side than to the other
when sleeping, I would remind you that
this is frequently the cause of an ill-balanced
skull, destructive of that beautiful symmetry
characteristic of the normal adult members
of both our species. Moreover, let not thy
offspring accustom herself to chewing her
food on one side of her mouth&mdash;a common
affectation among infants. The danger from
this source is teeth short on one side and
long on the other, and a jaw awry. In
these days, as you well know, Fatimah, it is
difficult to obtain for a daughter a desirable
mate if she be not well favored."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," said Fatimah,
when Duchess had ceased speaking. "You'll
excuse me now, I'm sure; my baby hasn't
had a nap since it was born."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>Presently, all through the Menial World
was heard the plaintive melody of the
Hippopotamus Cradle Song, and for an
hour after it had ceased, even Pwit-Pwit
and the Monkeys were silent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<div class="figleftini" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/073.jpg" alt="I" style="width: 100%" />
</div>

<p><br /><br />n the absence of the
Princess, it was the
little Limping Boy's
habit, when visiting his friends
of the Menial World, to interpret
for his own entertainment the
conversations he overheard. He believed
that he did this only in his mind, but on
several occasions he had translated the language
of Caliph or Mahmoud in such loud
tones, influenced by the exciting character of
their discourse, that other visitors had looked
at each other significantly, tapping their
foreheads and smiling. Of all this, however,
the little Limping Boy, fortunately, was
oblivious.</p>

<p>One morning he stood alone before the
door of Mahmoud and the Duchess. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>was the day after the Keeper and several
helpers had thrown Mahmoud's mate on
her side, tied her fast with ropes, and, with
hammer and chisel, had pared her toe-nails,
which had grown so long as to lame her.
The elephants stood with their heads together,
swaying their trunks. The boy at
once perceived that they were discussing the
nail-paring incident.</p>

<p>"Of a truth," said Mahmoud, "when the
men came with ropes I was as apprehensive
as thou, O Light of my Life. Thou wert
aged and lame, and I trembled at the thought
that they were about to put thee out of thy
misery. Happily, it was not so. And thy
lameness this morning, my beloved, hath it
disappeared?"</p>

<p>"My Lord," said Duchess, "my four feet
are now as firm on the ground as when,
years ago, I ran free and thoughtless in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>Jungle. I feel no pain, and my heart is
filled with gratitude to the men with the
knives who looked so cruel and were yet
so kind."</p>

<p>For a moment the two great beasts were
silent, gently caressing each other with their
trunks. Then Mahmoud spoke:</p>

<p>"Had I reflected, O Joy of my Heart, I
could have saved thee all thy apprehensions.
But it was not until they had released thee
that I remembered. Look thou, Duchess,
at the under side of my trunk and tell me
what thou seest there."</p>

<p>Mahmoud raised his trunk in the air, and
his mate inspected it carefully, feeling its
under side from lip to tip. Presently she
said, with surprise and some reproach in her
tones:</p>

<p>"Why hast thou concealed thy wounds
from me, thy faithful mate, my Lord?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>Almost from lip to tip thou art scarred as
though by lion's claws. Surely this is since
we came from the Jungle? Then, when I
was young and my eyes keen, thou couldst
not have concealed from me these dreadful
wounds."</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/077.jpg" alt="I
roamed the country at the head of a train" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>"Calm thyself, O Light of my Life," said
Mahmoud, soothingly. "Canst thou remember
the time long before we came to
this pleasant place, when, for many weary
months, we were separated, my beloved?"</p>

<p>"Aye, well, my Lord. It was the time
when, day after day, I marched at the head
of a long train of gaudily painted wagons in
which were Menial People of every sort,
stopping now and then at towns and villages
for the pleasure of the Master People, who
came by thousands to see us. And where
wert thou, my Lord, during that dreary
time of our separation?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>"In the summer," said Mahmoud, "I
roamed the country at the head of a train
of Menial People, as didst
thou. But in the winter
I was housed
with many
others where iron boxes
contained fire wherewith
to warm us. It is to this same fire that I
owe these wounds."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/078.jpg" alt="the lion, escaped from his cage" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>"I, too, have seen this red danger," said
Duchess, with a shudder. "Once, in the
Jungle, it roared and pursued me among
the dried reeds till my sides were scorched
and I was near dying of fatigue. Didst thou
say, my Lord, that the Master
People imprison those scorching
red tongues in iron boxes?"</p>

<p>"Aye, thus it warms,
but pursueth not," answered
Mahmoud.
"Yet is there sometimes
danger, as I am
about to relate. It happened
one night in the middle of winter,
when the cold was so severe that the man
who watched stretched himself out on the
floor at the very side of the iron box, which
was as red without as it was within, that old
Sultan, the lion, escaped from his cage, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>walked abroad within the large house. In
passing the red box, he lashed his tail thereon
and was stung by the fire so that he
howled. But ere the watcher could rise,
Sultan, roaring with anger, leaped on the
red box, overturning it, so that it fell and
held fast the foot of the man that watched.
Instantly did the man set up a great outcry,
for the fire stung him also, and the weight
of the red box held him so that he could
not rise.</p>

<p>"Now it happened," continued Mahmoud,
"that the man who watched had
shown me many kindnesses, and I was
loath to see him suffer pain. Therefore,
breaking the chain that held me in my
stall, I ran to the iron box, wrapped my
trunk about it and quickly set it on its legs,
as, many times in the Jungle, I have carried
the hewn logs for the Master People. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>was not until the watcher was released and
arose, limping, to his feet in safety, that I
felt the sting of the fire&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Remarkable! Most remarkable!"</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/080.jpg" alt="... to his feet in safety" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>This interruption, uttered in a gruff, unfamiliar
voice, caused the little Limping Boy
to turn and look to see who
was the speaker.
But he saw only the
swaying branches of
some shrubbery near
by, and so went on
interpreting Mahmoud's
tale.</p>

<p>"The pain grew each moment more severe,
so that I groaned with the agony of
it," continued the elephant. "The man
who watched returned me to my stall and
put oil on my wounds. The oil availed
little. For days my agony continued. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>Keeper and his helpers could give me no relief.
Great patches of skin fell from my
trunk, leaving my wounds raw and bleeding.
Thus I suffered in the full belief that my
wounds were mortal, and that I should
never see thee again, my beloved, when one
day the Keeper brought to my stall a large
man with yellow hair and beard, who carried
in his hand a black bag, and who, as he examined
my wounded trunk, kept saying
'hum' and 'ha' in a gruff voice. Yet I felt
in my heart that he desired to afford me
relief&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Remarkable! Most remarkable!"</p>

<p>It was the same gruff voice; but again the
little Limping Boy was unable to discover
whence it came, and so gave his attention
once more to the elephant.</p>



<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/082.jpg" alt="men came with ropes" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>"Therefore, when men came with ropes,"
said Mahmoud, "I made no resistance, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>lay down of my own accord and suffered
them to bind me. Thereupon the gruff
man opened his black bag and took therefrom
sundry bright knives and needles; also
some bottles and strips of gauze. Though
his voice was gruff, I found his
touch most soft and gentle.
First, he
bathed my wounds with some sweet-smelling
stuff, and then, with a keen knife&mdash;so keen
was it that I knew not when it touched me,
though it brought streams of blood&mdash;the
man pared away the diseased skin. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>confess that the gruff man's next act puzzled
me somewhat at first. While his helpers
held my trunk out straight, ever and anon
bathing it with a soothing liquid, he washed
with great care the thin, tender skin under
my forelegs. A sharp pain, at which I
made no outcry, however, in the same region,
caused me to turn my eyes in that direction.
The gruff man, with another very
sharp knife, was taking from my legs narrow
strips of the living skin and laying them,
one after another, on the raw flesh of my
trunk. Ere long the wounds were all covered,
and when strips of cloth had been
bound about them, holding them fast, the
ropes were taken from me, and I was permitted
to rise. From that day all my pain
ceased, and soon only the scars which thou
hast seen, O Light of my Life, remained as
a witness of the merciful deed of the gruff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>man with the yellow hair and beard."</p>

<p>"Remarkable! Most remarkable!"</p>

<p>This time when the little Limping Boy
turned at the interruption, he saw the Princess
coming from the shrubbery, eagerly
dragging after her by the hand a large man
in whose yellow hair and beard there were
some streaks of gray.</p>

<p>"Oh, Toots!" called out the Princess, as
they approached the door of the Elephant
House, "here's papa. We heard your translation
of Mahmoud's story, and it's wonderful.
I told papa you could do it, but he
wouldn't believe it till his own ears convinced
him."</p>

<p>"And so you're Toots," said the Princess'
father. "My little daughter says that you
translate the talk of the animals. Hum, ha,
where did you get that story about the elephant
skin-grafting you've just been telling?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, papa," said the Princess, reproachfully,
"he got it from Mahmoud."</p>

<p>"Hum, ha," grunted the large man to
himself, "the boy got it from the Keeper&mdash;probably
the same one that took me out to
Bridgeport for that case in Barnum's menagerie.
Hum, ha, let's see, that was six
years ago last winter. Hum, ha." And the
large man looked sharply at Toots.</p>

<p>"My little daughter calls you 'Toots';
what's your real name?"</p>

<p>"Edward Vine, sir."</p>

<p>"Hum, ha, poetical; goes well with his
powerful imagination. What does your
father do?"</p>

<p>"My father is dead, sir."</p>

<p>"Poor boy! Hum, ha. What does your
mother do?"</p>

<p>"Makes embroidery, sir."</p>

<p>"Any brothers or sisters?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Eleven last June, sir."</p>

<p>"Hum, ha," said the gruff man.</p>

<p>Toots now saw that when the Princess'
father said "hum, ha," he was talking to
himself. He stood with his back against
the rail in front of Mahmoud's stall. The
old elephant was acting strangely. At every
exclamation of "hum, ha," he would flap
his ears and move a step nearer the large
man.</p>

<p>"Hum, ha," mused the large man gruffly,
again, as he took off his hat to wipe the
perspiration from his brow, over which swept
the grayish yellow locks. Instantly Mahmoud
gave one of his little squeals of delight
and began fondling the large man with the
tip of his trunk.</p>

<p>"Why, he remembers you, sir," said Toots.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>"Or else he mistakes you for the surgeon
who mended his trunk."</p>

<p>"Hum, ha, he doesn't mistake me, boy.
I am the surgeon who mended his trunk.
I flatter myself that it was the first case
of elephant skin-grafting ever attempted.
Hum, ha." And having closely inspected
the scars on the old elephant's proboscis, the
large man said "hum, ha," several more
times, evidently with great satisfaction, then
said to Toots:</p>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/089.jpg" alt="Do it while you're asleep." style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>"What's the matter with your leg?"</p>

<p>"It's too short, sir."</p>

<p>"Born so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. It was broken below the
knee when I was six years old, and my
mother was too poor to get a good surgeon."</p>

<p>"Hum, ha; let's have a look at it."</p>

<p>The surgeon, whose hands were large,
white and soft, and as gentle as his voice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>was gruff, unfastened the straps of iron and
felt of Toots' poor, crippled leg, saying
"hum, ha," a great many times as he did so.
At length he replaced the irons, looked the
boy sharply in the face, and asked:</p>

<p>"How would you like to wear it like the
other one, for a change?"</p>

<p>"Oh, would that be possible, sir?" asked
Toots, turning pale.</p>

<p>"Easy as"&mdash;the gruff man looked around
to see if he could find anything so easy as
making Toots' leg an inch and a half longer,
and noticed Mahmoud&mdash;"easy as growing
new skin on an elephant's trunk. Hum, ha,
easier."</p>

<p>"Would it hurt?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Do it while you're asleep.
Then you lie on your back a couple of
weeks, after which you go out on my
farm with my little daughter and stay till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>you can jump up and crack your heels
together twice. Hum, ha. Tell your
mother to bring you to the hospital at
three o'clock to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you! Thank you!" was
all Toots could say.</p>

<p>"Hum, ha, any
friend of Mahmoud
is a friend of mine,"
said the Princess'
father.</p>

<p>It all happened exactly
according to the promise of
the gruff man with the gentle
hands&mdash;a little dream of pain in
his leg, then two weeks on his back in the
hospital bed, where the Princess visited him
daily with all sorts of dainties, and then,
when he could walk about a bit, a long
journey into the country.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<p>There, in the bright sunshine, with the
birds and butterflies glancing all about him,
and the woods and fields calling to him to
explore them, he grew strong once more,
until, little by little, he learned to get along
so gloriously that he could hardly make himself
believe that he was the same boy at all.
And for this great blessing, which in all his
life he had never dared hope for, Toots felt
from the very bottom of his heart that he
was indebted to the friendship and intimacy
which he had come to have with old
Mahmoud.</p>

</div>


<p><br />oots sat on the smooth
top of a boulder on the
river bank, gazing deep
down into the pool at
his feet. The pool was shaded
by the overhanging branches
of a cottonwood tree. The
warm air was filled with the
fragrance of the country. It had painted
the boy's cheeks a healthy brown, and
caused him to thrill with a sense of strength
that was new and delightful. The good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>surgeon's promise was fulfilled; Toots' leg
was now as straight as that of any boy, and
no longer was it burdened by the weight of
iron straps. Concerning the iron straps he
had just one regret; when he returned to
his friends, the Menial People, would Mahmoud
be able to recognize him, thus bereft
of those symbols of their affinity? He would
soon know, for he and the Princess&mdash;whose
guest Toots was at her father's country home
during the period of his convalescence&mdash;were
to return in a few days.</p>



<div class="figright" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/093.jpg" alt="the Princess played
beside a little brook" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>Near where Toots sat, the Princess played
beside a little brook that gurgled over its
bed of cobble-stones. She was amusing herself
poking the end of a stick under the
stones in the bed of the brook. Occasionally
a crawfish would dart out backward,
glare at her savagely with its beady eyes and
snap its clumsy claws at the stick, whereupon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>the Princess would utter a ladylike little
shriek and retire to another part of the
brook. Suddenly she clapped her hands
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, here comes
Reginald!"</p>

<p>The Princess ran to
meet a trim, precise looking
young man in a linen helmet,
canvas coat and trousers
and a pair of high boots,
who was coming down the
steep bank with a beautiful
new rod and
reel on his shoulder.
Slung across
the other shoulder
was a large bag. This was to put his fish
in&mdash;when he had caught them. Toots
never moved from his seat on the boulder.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now, if you children will keep quiet,"
said Reginald, as he fastened a brilliant contrivance
of scarlet feathers and glittering
silver on the end of his slender silken line,
"we shall have fried pike for supper."</p>

<p>"I'd rather have pickerel, if you please,"
said Toots.</p>

<p>"Pickerel never bite at this time of day,"
answered Reginald, with authority. He
stepped to the water's edge, where the brook
entered the river, and raised his rod. Swish!
went the delicate bit of bamboo through the
air, the reel whizzed and the silken line shot
far down the stream. When the glittering
bauble at its end struck the water, Reginald
wound up the reel slowly, anxiously watching
the tip of the rod. Toots and the
Princess looked on in silence, the Princess
because of her admiration for the natty figure,
and Toots out of politeness. But the
boy had small respect for Reginald's abilities
as a fisherman. Farmer John, with his
crooked old pole and grubs for bait, was
Toots' ideal in the fishing line. Besides,
John had told him about the Pickerel Family
whose home was in this same pool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a><br /><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/095.jpg">
<img src="images/095_th.jpg" alt="Elephants" style="width: 50%" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center">Suddenly the Princess exclaimed: "Oh, here comes
Reginald!"</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>


<p>Yes, John's story must be quite true, for
now as he turned his gaze from
the unprofitable fisherman back
to the pool, Toots was sure he
could see shadowy figures floating
in and out among the rocks. Certainly
there was Grandfather Pickerel,
the patriarch of the family. Toots
could see him now quite plainly. He was
having a domestic discussion with two other
pickerel who bore a strong family resemblance
to him.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/097.jpg" alt="Fish" style="width: 100%" />
</div>




<p>"They must be Father and Mother Pickerel,"
thought Toots.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Darting about near by, Toots could see
the whole brood of young pickerels. They
were of all sizes, from Big Brother Pickerel,
who was nearly as large as his father, down
to Baby Pickerel, who was hardly larger
than a minnow. Suddenly Toots realized
that something of unusual importance was
going on at the bottom of the pool, for as
his eyes grew more accustomed to the wavering
lights and shadows in the water, he
could see, swimming about in the near
neighborhood of the Pickerel Family, a
whole troop of collateral relations. He recognized
Uncle Pike by his fierce look and
by the way he ordered the other relations
about. Toots knew Aunt Bass by her plump
figure and the bright silver suit she wore.
She was swimming here and there, conversing
amiably with everybody. Miss Catfish,
a distant and poor relation, was lingering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>modestly in the background. Nobody
seemed to be paying any attention to her
except Big Brother Pickerel, who kept edging
over in her direction, only to be pursued,
reprimanded and driven back to the
inner family
circle
by Mother
Pickerel.
Toots felt that revelations of the utmost significance
were impending. He hardly dared
to breathe. Just then his observations
were interrupted by the shrill voice of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>Princess: "Toots! Toots! John's coming!"</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/099.jpg" alt="Pwit-Pwit" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>This was different. Toots scrambled
down from the boulder and ran to meet the
big man with the tattered straw hat who
was approaching with his crooked fish-pole
on his shoulder. In one hand John carried
a rusty oyster can which appeared to be full
of dirt. Toots stuck his fingers into the
dirt and brought something white to the
surface.</p>

<p>"They're grubs," he exclaimed delightedly.
"Now we <i>shall</i> have fried pickerel
for supper."</p>

<p>Reginald was reeling in his line. His
face wore a look of discontent.</p>

<p>"Don't seem to have much appetite for
red feathers to-day, do they?" said John, as
he stuck a grub on his hook and dropped it
into the pool.</p>

<p>Reginald muttered something between his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>teeth, and walked toward the rock where
the Princess was standing. She gave him a
look of consolation. Toots was clambering
up beside her. It was a good place from
which to watch John.</p>

<p>"Go away," said the Princess, drawing her
short skirts about her. "Go away; you smell
of grubs."</p>

<p>But she held out her hand to Reginald
and smiled on him in her most fascinating
manner. Toots went and stood by the side
of John. At that moment the big man gave
a sharp tug at the crooked pole, and a shining
pickerel over a foot long lay flopping on
the stones. Toots viewed the fish at close
range with bulging eyes, and said:</p>

<p>"Why, I know him. It's the father of the
little pickerels."</p>

<p>"That so?" said John, sticking another
grub on his hook and dropping it into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>pool again. "Well, we'll eat him fried for
supper just the same."</p>

<p>Toots' lip quivered. "Where will the little
pickerels get another father?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They don't need any," said John.
"Grandfather Pickerel will look after them.
He's a wise old chap. Nobody's going to
get a chance to fry him in a hurry. I've
hooked him half a dozen times, but I've
never had a chance to fry him yet."</p>

<p>"Did he get away?" asked Toots.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say he did. You never
see more than the tip of the old sinner's
nose. When he's given you a glimpse of
that, he bites off the line and flops back into
his hole."</p>

<p>Toots reflected for several moments, and
then inquired: "What becomes of the
hook, John?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he swallows the hook," answered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>big man, testily. "His stomach must be half
full of old iron by this time."</p>

<p>This was an interesting situation. Toots
turned it over in his mind slowly. Presently
his attention was diverted by an exclamation
from John.</p>

<p>"Durn his skin!" the big man was saying.
"Blest if I don't believe I've got him again!"</p>

<p>John's line was being dragged frantically
about in the pool. The pole bent and
splashed in the water. The big man's hat
came off. Reginald and the Princess interrupted
their flirtation to join Toots beside
the pool.</p>

<p>"Out of the way, you folks!" shouted
John. "Give me room. I'm going to land
the old sinner this time, or know the reason
why."</p>

<p>All at once the crooked pole snapped
in two, and John fell backward with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>heels in the air. The next instant he had
dashed into the pool up to his shoulders, and
seized the small end of the pole, to which
the line was attached.</p>




<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/104.jpg" alt="The big man stepped
out of the water" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>"Reel him in, why don't you?" sang out
Reginald, laughing.</p>

<p>"Reel nothing," said John, wrathfully,
from the middle of the pool.
"The only way to get this
fish out is to jump on his back
and ride him out."</p>

<p>John concluded
to compromise by
leading him out.
He had wound several
yards of the line
about his arm, and
was wading toward the shore. The fish was
suspiciously quiet. The big man stepped
out of the water and drew in the line,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>hand over hand. Toots could see the dim
outlines of the fish as he allowed himself
to be drawn toward the water's edge.
Suddenly he clapped his hands and cried
out gleefully:</p>

<p>"I know him! I know him! It's Grandfather
Pickerel."</p>

<p>"So do I know him," said John. "Just
you wait till I get my hands on him."</p>

<p>At length Grandfather Pickerel's long,
sharp nose appeared above the water. The
big man stepped back ready for one long,
strong pull at the right instant. The wary
old fish opened his lean jaws to their full
width, and brought them together with a
vicious snap. It was at exactly the right
moment. Once more John lay on his back
with his heels in the air, while Grandfather
Pickerel glided with much dignity into the
depths of the pool.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now, if you had had my rod and reel,"
said Reginald, "you could have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your rod and reel be durned," said John,
as he picked up the fish lying on the stones,
and started up the bank with it. "If ever
that old sinner gets hold of your rod and
reel, he'll make toothpicks of 'em."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Food never drops out of a clear sky. When the sky is
dark with clouds, it sometimes rains toads; that is different. I
have yet to hear of a barbed iron hook being concealed in the
flesh of a toad. Insects and other morsels that float down the
brook into the pool come to us in the regular course of nature,
and may be swallowed without question.</p>

<p class="right">
&mdash;<i>Maxims of Grandfather Pickerel.</i><br /><br />
</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Toots went back to the boulder by
the river's margin that same afternoon,
and resumed his observation
of the Pickerel Family at home. Reginald
was taking a nap on the grassy slope of the
river bank, and the Princess was tenderly
waving her handkerchief over his face to
keep off the flies. On a rainy day not long
afterward Toots gave her the following account
of his observations:</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/108.jpg" alt="They
chattered about her" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>Mother Pickerel was worried. She expected
company, and everything was at sixes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>and sevens. The little pickerels were quarrelsome,
and were constantly getting in her
way. She cuffed them with her fins, and
asked them what they supposed their Aunt
Bass would think of their conduct. The
little Pickerels loved
their Aunt Bass, she
was so amiable
and entertaining. They
chattered about her
with their noses close together under the
rocks where the brook entered the pool.
Aunt Bass was not fierce and greedy like
Uncle Pike. Sometimes she came over to
the pool at sundown, and amused them by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>leaping far out of the water to catch fireflies.
And she would tell them such lovely stories
of all she saw in the strange upper world,
where there was nothing to swim in. She
was delightful. The little pickerels disputed
angrily about
which of them
should go to
meet her.
They chased each other about and blundered
rudely into the corner where Grandfather
Pickerel was trying to have a quiet
nap. The old fellow grumbled so loudly
at this interruption that Mother Pickerel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>had to leave her work again. She cuffed
them right and left, saying:</p>



<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/109.jpg" alt="Grandfather Pickerel" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>"How often have I told you not to disturb
your grandfather when he is taking his
nap? And his stomach troubling him so!
Don't you know it rained last night? Oh,
you bad children, to worry your grandfather
after a rain when his stomach hurts him so."</p>

<p>Just then Father Pickerel came home.
Hearing what had happened, he went at
once and apologized to Grandfather Pickerel.
Presently Mother Pickerel joined
them. Baby Pickerel sneaked up near
enough to hear what they were saying. After
a little she rejoined her brothers and sisters,
looking very important.</p>

<p>"What are they talking about?" demanded
the other little pickerels, in a chorus.</p>

<p>"About Big Brother," said Baby Pickerel.
"I just knew that was what was the matter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>He's been gallivanting again after that ill-bred
Miss Catfish. He can't be found
anywhere. Uncle Pike's gone after him,
and pretty
soon there's
going to be a
regular picnic,
I can tell
you. All the relations are
coming. I expect Big
Brother's going to catch it this time."</p>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/111.jpg" alt="Miss Pickerel turned up her nose" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>Miss Pickerel turned up her nose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>disdainfully. "The idea of Brother running
after that Catfish girl. What shocking bad
taste! Did you notice what a horrid big
mouth she has?"</p>

<p>"And she hasn't got a decent suit of scales
to her back," chimed in the next to the
youngest Pickerel.</p>

<p>"She actually eats mud," said Baby Pickerel.
"I saw her do it only the other day.
When she noticed that I saw her, she looked
ashamed and sneaked away."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear that she is not
lost to all sense of shame," said Miss Pickerel,
with a toss of her head.</p>

<p>"For my part," said one of the little
Pickerels who had not yet spoken, "I'd
about as lief be a low-bred catfish as a greedy,
quarrelsome pike."</p>

<p>"S-s-s-h!" said Miss Pickerel, warningly,
"the Pikes are our relations."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't care if they are. Uncle Pike is
perfectly disgraceful. He snatches the fattest
tadpoles and gulps them down at a single
mouthful before any one else has a
chance at them. He has the most enormous
appetite. It's unnatural, too, I'm sure.
Yesterday I saw him sneaking about after
Baby. Do you know, I have an idea he
could tell what became of little Cousin Bass
last summer. It made me shudder to see
him watching Baby with his big,
greedy eyes. I went and told
Grandfather, and they had some
warm words about it."</p>



<div class="figright" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/113.jpg" alt="Aunt Bass" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>As they listened to this gruesome
tale, the other little pickerels
turned pale and were silent. They did
not recover their accustomed spirits until
Aunt Bass bustled in among them, giving
each a pat with her gentle fin. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>closely followed by Uncle Pike, who was
driving before him Big Brother Pickerel and
Miss Catfish. Big Brother Pickerel kept a
protecting fin spread above Miss Catfish, and
his bold features bore an
expression of defiance.
Miss Catfish was pale
and trembling.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/114.jpg" alt="Big Brother Pickerel kept a
protecting fin spread above Miss Catfish" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p>"If I were in her
place," whispered Miss
Pickerel to her brothers
and sisters, "I should
want the earth to open and
swallow me up!"</p>

<p>The Pickerel Family and all
the relations drew up in line
and looked with severity at Big Brother
Pickerel, who continued his protecting attitude
toward Miss Catfish. At length Grandfather
Pickerel spoke.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>"Grandson," said he, "it is more in sorrow
than in anger that we are gathered here.
Speak. Do you insist on bringing that
young person into this respectable family?"</p>

<p>"I do," answered Big Brother Pickerel,
firmly; "and as for the respectability of the
family, I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do, sir!" thundered Grandfather
Pickerel, in a terrible voice. "So be
it. Miss Catfish, consider yourself raised to
our level. Your apartment is under the
seventeenth cobble-stone to the left of where
the brook enters the pool. Spare your protestations
of gratitude, I beg of you. <i>Our</i>
feelings are too deep for words."</p>

<p>At this instant the proceedings were interrupted
by a dazzling object that dropped
into the water a short distance down the
stream, and came glinting and whirling
through the pool. Big Brother Pickerel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>made a dash for it, but Grandfather Pickerel
hit him such a slap with the flat of his tail
that he fell back, dazed, to the bottom of
the pool.</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/116.jpg" alt="Do you insist on bringing that
young person into this respectable family?" style="width: 100%" /></div>


<p>"Idiot! Look up and see what you were
jumping at."</p>

<p>When the others looked in the direction
indicated by Grandfather Pickerel, they saw a
most amusing thing. A dapper
young man was actually
trying to deceive them with
some scarlet feathers
and a silver bangle at
the end of a line.
Even Baby Pickerel
knew better. Big Brother
Pickerel looked very much ashamed. He
tried to explain that his nervousness over
domestic matters had temporarily warped his
judgment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Grandfather Pickerel rose cautiously toward
the surface of the pool to see whether
any more formidable enemy was in sight.
He saw Toots sitting on the boulder, but
there was nothing to cause alarm in that.
On the contrary, Grandfather Pickerel regarded
Toots in the light of a friend and
sympathizer. He had only one reason to
be at all doubtful concerning him.
He sometimes came down to the
pool with the terribly fascinating
big man in the tattered straw
hat. Grandfather Pickerel felt
a dyspeptic twinge in the pit of his stomach
as he recalled his experiences with the big
man. As he sank back into the pool, the
other pickerels noticed that he appeared
grave and preoccupied. This meant that
the head of the family was turning something
over in his mind that he would shortly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>communicate to them. So they approached
in a respectful semicircle, and waited expectantly.
Grandfather Pickerel cast his
eye over his audience, and asked:</p>

<p>"Where is my son?"</p>

<p>"Father has gone to see Aunt Bass home,"
answered Mother Pickerel; "he will return
in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Grandfather Pickerel cleared his throat,
and looking severely at Big Brother Pickerel,
said:</p>

<p>"I must again warn you of the necessity
of using care and judgment in the selection
of your food. I will pass over the humiliating
scene we have just witnessed, simply
reminding you that dazzling objects which
seem to drop out of the sky should never
be construed as food. My youngest grandchild
would be ashamed to act as you have
done, sir!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>Big Brother Pickerel hung his head, while
Baby Pickerel swelled with pride to twice
her natural size. At this instant the brilliant
combination of scarlet and silver again
came whirling through the water above their
heads. The whole Pickerel family gazed at
it without the slightest evidence of emotion,
whereat Grandfather Pickerel gave them a
benignant smile, and continued:</p>

<p>"As a general rule, everything that drops
into the pool is to be regarded with suspicion.
Food never drops out of a clear sky.
When the sky is dark with clouds it sometimes
rains toads; that is different. I have
yet to hear of a barbed iron hook being
found concealed in the flesh of a toad. Insects
and other morsels that float down the
brook into the pool come to us in the regular
course of nature, and may be swallowed
without question."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>Here Grandfather Pickerel stopped and
reflected for a moment. Presently he added:</p>

<p>"Regarding objects that seem to drop
out of the sky, I think of one exception&mdash;grasshoppers"&mdash;the
little pickerels smacked
their lips at mention of this delectable morsel&mdash;"which
may either fly into the pool
from a distance or leap in from the bank.</p>

<p>"I now come," said the patriarch, "to the
most deadly danger with which we have to
deal. I refer to the powerful fascination
which seems to be exercised over us by those
big two-legged creatures in tattered straw
hats, carrying long, crooked poles over their
shoulders, who come down to the pool and
lure us to destruction with grubs impaled on
sharp iron hooks. I don't know how to
account for it," said Grandfather Pickerel,
shaking his head and turning pale about the
gills, "except on the theory of hypnotism&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, here comes papa!" interrupted Baby
Pickerel.</p>

<p>But the others were gazing in consternation
at the patriarch, who was now white
clear to the tip of his tail and shaking with
terror. He was staring upward with wild,
distended eyes. The others looked also and
understood. The big man was there with
his crooked pole. They felt themselves
drawn toward him. He was throwing something
into the pool.</p>

<p>"Back! Back!" shouted Grandfather
Pickerel. "Back for your lives!" But the
warning was too late. Father Pickerel, approaching
from the middle of the river,
jumped at the white grub, and all was over.
The bereaved Pickerel family saw him dangling
helplessly at the end of the big man's
line, then disappearing into the unknown
world where there is nothing to swim in.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>
<p>"Back under the rocks, all of you!" thundered
Grandfather Pickerel. "There is only
one thing to be done. I must have that
hook, or soon there'll be none left to tell
the tale. Thank heaven, I have two sound
teeth in my head yet."</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 35%">
<img src="images/122.jpg" alt="Didn't Grandfather get the hook after all?" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>With bated breath and quivering fins
the other
pickerels peered out
from under the rocks at
the desperate struggle
which immediately ensued. It was short,
but decisive. The waters of the pool were
lashed into foam. The little pickerels were
half-mad with terror. All at once they gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>a loud cheer. The victorious patriarch was
returning. There was bloody foam on his
jaws, but several inches of fish-line hung
from between them. The aged hero paid
no attention to the cheering, but swam dejectedly
into the farthest corner of his den.
Mother Pickerel followed him in silence.
When she returned, her eyes were red.</p>

<p>"Didn't Grandfather get the hook after
all?" asked Baby Pickerel.</p>

<p>"Hush, dear," said Mother Pickerel, wiping
her eyes with the tip of her tail. "Yes,
your grandfather has the hook safe in the
pit of his stomach along with all the others,
and it is paining him dreadfully."</p>

<p>The Princess was still fanning the flies
away from the face of Reginald. John was
cultivating corn on the high bank of the
river. Every five or six minutes he turned his
team near by from one row into the next one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>Toots remembered John's extra pole and line
concealed behind the old cottonwood. He
went and got it. But how about bait?
Then Toots had a second inspiration. He
recalled Grandfather Pickerel's remark about
grasshoppers. There were plenty of them
all about. At that instant a fat one dropped
out of the tree and lay with its long legs on
the rocks at Toots' feet. The boy, as tenderly
as possible, stuck it on the hook and
went back to the boulder. First, he would
see what was going on in the bosom of the
Pickerel Family.</p>

<p>Mother Pickerel was asking Grandfather
Pickerel if he didn't think he'd better take
a bite of something to stay his stomach till
dinner-time.</p>

<p>"There's some nice tender tadpoles over
in the mouth of the brook," she said. "Do
try half a dozen raw, dearie, won't you?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<p>It was at that very instant that Toots'
grasshopper, with the hook through the small
of his back, jumped out of his hands into the
pool. Before the boy had time to realize
what had happened, the line and then the
pole began moving of their own accord
toward the water's edge. Toots grabbed
the pole and was nearly dragged into the
pool. He looked around and saw John
turning his team on the high bank.</p>

<p>"I've got him, John! Come here quick!"
yelled Toots.</p>

<p>Reginald awoke barely in time to seize
the end of the pole before it and Toots had
been dragged into the water. John came
tearing down the bank, shouting at the top
of his voice:</p>

<p>"Don't fight him yet. Give him the line!
Give him the line!"</p>

<p>"He's got the line," said Reginald, "and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>he seems to want the pole, too. Now is
the time when fifty yards of silk and a good
reel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here, give me the pole," said John;
"we'll see who's master this time."</p>

<p>Then followed a most exciting scene.
When at last Grandfather Pickerel's nose
appeared above the surface of the pool, John
hadn't a dry rag to his back. The big man
was amazed to see that the old pickerel
made no attempt to bite off the line. When
he had him safely landed, the first thing he
did was to look in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm durned," said John. "The
old sinner hasn't a tooth left in his head."</p>

<p>As Toots gazed on the form of the vanquished
patriarch, all his pride of conquest
was swallowed up in a great wave of pity.</p>

<p>"He'll never swallow any more fish-hooks,
will he, John?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, I guess not," said the big man;
"the frying pan will stop all that nonsense."</p>

<p>"It seems a pity to fry the old chap,"
said Toots. "He's lost all his teeth and
can't do any more damage."</p>

<p>"That's so," answered John, good naturedly;
"maybe you'd rather put him in the
spring, and keep him for a pet?"</p>

<p>But Toots was thinking of the grief of the
Pickerel Family. How would Mother Pickerel
be able to get along with both Father
and Grandfather Pickerel no more, especially
considering the doubtful character of
Big Brother Pickerel, with his tendency to
overturn the established order of society?
When he had thought it all over, he
said:</p>

<p>"No, John, I'd rather put him back in
the pool, where he can continue to care for
the little Pickerels."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>And thus the patriarch of the Pickerel
Family, wiser than any of his race, before
or since, was restored to those who had such
grave need of his guidance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class="figleftini" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/129.jpg" alt="T" style="width: 100%" />
</div>


<p><br /><br />he country of the Menial
People lay white and
frozen under its blanket
of snow when Toots and
the Princess next visited
it. They stood before the
cage of the lion cubs on
the morning of the first snowfall of the year.</p>

<p>"By my claws and teeth, all the earth is
white!" exclaimed the largest of the cubs, as
he looked through his barred window.</p>

<p>"The world must be coming to an end,"
said a shivering puma, curling up in the farthest
corner of his cage.</p>

<p>"Ho, there, Sultan!" cried out one of the
young tigers; "you are old and full of wisdom,
tell us why all the land is white, and
why our teeth chatter so."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>Old Sultan rose thereupon, and having
walked majestically to the front of his dwelling,
lifted up his voice and said:</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/130.jpg" alt="Sultan" style="width: 100%" />
</div>




<p>"It is well that you children should know
that we are no longer in the Jungle of our
fathers. For some reason, I know not what,
we have been brought captive into
the far North, where, ever
and anon, the earth is
white, and our hair
stands out stiff and
harsh. However, I
would counsel you
to be patient and
calm. The food is
wholesome and plenty, and is laid each
day conveniently at our very feet."</p>

<p>"That is indeed so," assented the mother
lioness. "It is a great burden off my mind
to know that though my claws grow dull
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>with age, and my limbs too stiff to leap,
you children are still unpursued by the phantom
of hunger unappeased. Therefore, let
us be thankful." And she stretched herself
out on the floor of her house, and was soon
snoring comfortably.</p>

<p>The wise counsel of the older lions
calmed the cubs somewhat, but filled them
with so much curiosity about the jungle
home of their people that throughout the
day they kept those who had been born in
freedom busy answering their questions.
Thus it happened that neither Pwit-Pwit,
the sparrow, nor the little Limping Boy&mdash;who
no longer limped&mdash;could get the attention
of Mahmoud or Duchess, mate of
the aged elephant, till toward evening.</p>

<p>In the deepest snow of his yard stood
Wapiti, the red deer, with his head aloft,
his great branching antlers thrown back and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>his nostrils quivering. Pwit-Pwit flew up
and alighted on one of the prongs and
chirped merrily into the deer's ear:</p>

<p>"Glorious fun, this snow, isn't it, old fellow?"</p>

<p>But Wapiti stood sniffing the frosty air
and was silent.</p>

<p>"I know what is the matter with you,"
said the sparrow, "you are trying to remember
something that happened when it was
winter in the great woods where you ran
free."</p>

<p>Pwit-Pwit picked at the shreds of skin
hanging from Wapiti's antlers, and at length
the deer lowered his head and spoke:</p>

<p>"Go away now," he said, "but come back
again. I smell something in the air that
makes me feel like leaping and running
with all my speed. The memory of other
days is struggling to return. Just now I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>thought it was here. Come back after a
little, Pwit-Pwit. Give me time to collect
my thoughts."</p>

<p>With this the sparrow hopped down from
the deer's antlers at Toots' feet, and began
fluttering his wings and scolding at him.</p>

<p>"He is talking to you now," said the
Princess. "What does he say?"</p>

<p>"He wants us to come with him. Lead
the way," said Toots to the sparrow, "and
we will follow wherever you go."</p>

<p>Toots took the Princess' hand and started
a few steps, whereat Pwit-Pwit, with a chirp
of satisfaction, flew straight to the den of
the bears. When Toots and the Princess
arrived, they found the sparrow exhibiting
signs of disappointment and indignation.
The great beasts were curled up fast asleep
and snoring.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of that?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>demanded the sparrow. "A nice way to receive
visitors, that is. They know that I
always come when the sun shines full in
their doorway."</p>

<p>"The snow and the cold have made them
sleepy," said Toots.</p>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<img src="images/135.jpg" alt="Pwit-Pwit fluttered out of the bears' den" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>"Perhaps that is so," answered the sparrow&mdash;Toots
was translating their talk for the
Princess&mdash;"but it is stupid of them, and impolite,
and I won't have it."</p>

<p>With these words the sparrow flew at the
eyes of the oldest bear, pecking away with
all his might, and chirping:</p>

<p>"Come, now, will you wake up? You
have company for breakfast. Shame upon
you!"</p>

<p>But the old bear simply put his great
paws over his eyes and was presently snoring
louder than ever. It was the same with
the younger bears. They had eaten their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>breakfast, and were determined to sleep.</p>

<p>Pwit-Pwit fluttered out of the bears' den,
and fixing his
sparkling eyes
on Toots' face,
said:</p>

<p>"I know what
we'll do. We'll call on the racoons.
They're horrible little chatterboxes, but
they are inclined to be sociable. Besides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>I have been neglecting them of late."</p>

<p>So they went a little farther up the hill
to the Racoon House, with its door looking
toward the sun, which is always closed
at night. No sound came from within.</p>




<div class="figright" style="width: 15%">
<img src="images/138.jpg" alt="The old gray rabbit" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>"It is a little late to catch them at breakfast,"
said the sparrow; "but they are such
greedy people that some of them are sure to
be quarreling over the last morsel."</p>

<p>But, to the intense surprise of Pwit-Pwit,
all was silent within the Racoon House.
He hopped in at the door, and presently
returned, looking deeply disgusted.</p>

<p>"Would you believe it?" he said testily.
"Every one of those silly people is snoring
louder than the bears. Isn't it disgraceful?"</p>

<p>"They are like the bears," said Toots;
"the cold makes them drowsy."</p>

<p>"Well, I shan't go without my breakfast
any longer, simply because it is my duty to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>carry the early news to people who are too
stupid to listen to it," chirped Pwit-Pwit.
"I'm half-starved. Come, we will call on
the old gray rabbit. There is no one so
wise as he in all the Menial World&mdash;and he
always saves a choice morsel for me, though
I must confess that I prefer the fare of
Mahmoud."</p>

<p>It was only a few steps to the snowy
hillside where the old gray rabbit watched
over his large family, the youngest of which
was a snow-white great-granddaughter.
Without waiting for a special invitation,
Pwit-Pwit took possession of a bread crust,
and was pecking at it greedily, when a wonderful
thing happened. The old gray rabbit,
ignoring the sparrow, hopped slowly over
to where Toots and the Princess stood leaning
upon the top rail of his yard fence.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said the boy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>The rabbit stuck one of its ears straight
up and allowed the other to hang down over
his cheek, meanwhile moving his flexible lips
in the most extraordinary fashion.
Toots laughed aloud and clapped
his hands, saying: "Thank you,
Grandpa Rabbit, my
crooked leg is cured. This
is the Princess. Her father,
who is a great surgeon, made
it as straight as its mate. You
can see for yourself."</p>

<p>With perfect confidence in
Toots' ability to understand
the rabbit language,
the Princess bowed, and
then stroked Grandfather
Rabbit's ear. Then he hopped still closer to
the fence and made a long speech with his ears
and flexible lips. And this is what he said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a><br /><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/139.jpg">
<img src="images/139_th.jpg" alt="Rabbit" style="width: 50%" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center">The rabbit stuck one of its ears straight up.</p></div>
</div>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>"Little boy, I rejoice at your good fortune.
While your poor leg was still crooked,
and the iron clanked upon it, and you were
as thin and pale as you are now brown and
stout, you never neglected me. I always
felt that you understood me and mine better
than those great careless men who come with
the bread and the cabbage-leaves, but with
never a word of greeting. Even now, when
the ground is white and cold, you do not
forget us. We feel that you are one of
us. It is not given to all of the Menial
People to speak as plainly as I do, but you
have my earnest assurance that all have the
same feeling of affection toward you."</p>

<p>While the rabbit was speaking, Pwit-Pwit,
having satisfied his hunger, hopped up beside
him, and told him of the disgraceful conduct
of the bears and the racoons.</p>

<p>"I could have told you," answered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>rabbit, "that the first snow would deprive
you of all companionship on the part of
those people. It was their custom before
being taken into captivity to sleep steadily
through all the freezing weather. My people
understood it well, for then we had only
the wildcats, the wolves and the foxes to
fear."</p>

<p>"But how could they live so long without
eating?" demanded Pwit-Pwit. "When the
weather is cold, my appetite is sharper than
ever."</p>

<p>"They lived upon their fat," answered the
old gray rabbit. "All the time the leaves
were falling the bears ate grapes and berries
in the forest, until they were so fat they
could hardly walk. I remember we were
never afraid of them then, they were so slow
and clumsy. It was the same with the racoons.
All night they would steal along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>margin of the river, gorging themselves with
clams, fish and young ducks, and sometimes
would go into the fields for the juicy, green
corn. So, when the first snow came, they,
too, were almost too fat to walk.</p>

<p>"Then," continued the old gray rabbit,
"the bears would crawl into the farthest corner
of their caves, while the racoons would
curl up into furry rings at the ends of their
burrows, and there they would sleep soundly
until the warm sun should again melt the
snow. All these things I know well, for it
is during the first warm days of spring that
the rabbits are ever on the alert because of
the gaunt figures of the half-starved bears,
awakened by their hunger, which then prowl
over the land."</p>

<p>"Ah, now I understand," chirped Pwit-Pwit.
"Well, now that the bears and the
racoons care no longer for the news, I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>have more time than ever to devote to dear
old Mahmoud, and to Fatimah and the hippopotamus
baby."</p>

<p>Just then there came a wild bellow from
the direction of Wapiti's yard.</p>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 20%">
<img src="images/144.jpg" alt="Wapiti" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>"It's Wapiti," said Pwit-Pwit, much excited.
"Come at once. He remembers."</p>

<p>"If it is the deer you
are about to visit,"
said the rabbit, "I
would warn you that
his people are apt to
be dangerous when the
snow is on the ground.
It is then that they suffer
from hunger, and are
none too gentle with
their sharp prongs."</p>

<p>But Pwit-Pwit said
that he had a perfect understanding with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>Wapiti, and flew away, followed by Toots
and the Princess, both eager to know what
it was that the red deer had remembered.
They found him shaking his
antlers and pawing the snow.</p>

<p>"Now, I remember," he
said. "It was on just such a
day as this in the
great forest that my gentle, tender-eyed
mate was taken from me. There were two
fierce dogs that sprang at her throat. But
this was not until the iron in the man's hand
had spoken, and my mate had fallen to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>knees, with the blood gushing from her
mouth. Look, Pwit-Pwit, little one, do you
see that prong, broken short off?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the sparrow, eagerly.</p>

<p>The red deer tossed his head savagely,
then bellowed fiercely:</p>

<p>"It was with that same prong that I pinned
one of the dogs to a tree, so that he never
barked again. I left the prong sticking to
his heart."</p>



<div class="figright" style="width: 35%">
<img src="images/145.jpg" alt="But my poor mate was dead" style="width: 100%" />
</div>



<p>"Served him right," said Pwit-Pwit. "I
can't bear dogs; they're as bad as cats."</p>

<p>"But my poor mate was dead," continued
Wapiti, "and while I was mourning over her
body, the men came and bound me fast
with cords. That is why you find me here."</p>

<p>With that, they took leave of the red
deer, and with the sparrow in the lead, proceeded
to the Elephant House.</p>

<p>"By this time," said Toots, "the lion cubs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>will have ceased their chatter over the white
carpet the heavens laid on the earth in the
night, and we shall be able to get in a word."</p>

<p>Mahmoud and the Duchess stood as near
the front of their house as the chains on
their legs would let them, and seemed eager
for visitors. They greeted Pwit-Pwit cordially,
stretching out their trunks to him.
The sparrow hopped upon that of Mahmoud,
and said:</p>

<p>"Where are your eyes, old friend? Here
is the little Limping Boy back again, and
you give him not so much as a flap of your
ear in greeting."</p>

<p>"Alas, my eyes give me small service these
days," said the elephant; "yet I would have
sworn that the lad who follows you hither
with the little butterfly maiden is stout and
brown and well-clad, and with two good,
straight legs under him. Can it be that my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>ears are growing dull, also, that I failed to
hear the clank of the iron on his leg?"</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Mahmoud put forth his
trunk, and with the two fingers at its end
felt carefully of Toots' legs, first of one and
then of the other. Then he drew back and
blew a puff of wind through his trunk that
ruffled Pwit-Pwit's feathers, saying playfully:</p>

<p>"And so, Pwit-Pwit, little one, thou
wouldst jest with thy most faithful of friends?
Nay, the lad is well-favored and good to look
upon, but he is not the little Limping Boy."</p>

<p>And Mahmoud, turning his head resolutely,
began carrying to his mouth the
stack of hay the Keeper had placed before
him. Toots felt his heart torn as by a great
sorrow.</p>

<p>"Mahmoud! Mahmoud!" he sobbed,
holding out his arms.</p>

<p>But the elephant gave no heed to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>boy, and the sparrow had flown away.</p>

<p>Toots burst into tears.</p>

<p>"It is sad," said the Princess, putting her
handkerchief to her eyes, "but it is better
to be strong like other boys."</p>

<p>And she led him away, and when next
Toots and the Princess visited their friends
of the Menial World, he was tall, with hair
on his lip, and she was slender and very fair;
and they looked only in each other's eyes.</p>
